Hello!  This is a simple command line tool that tells you weather conditions.  It requires a .env file that contains an API key for OpenWeatherMap "APPID="API_KEY"".  Once that is in place, you can run the script with no arguments, and it will tell the weather of your geographical location.  Your geographical location is determined based on your public IP address, so it won't work properly if you're on a VPN.  You can pass the arguments c or f change between celcius and fahrenheit, althought fahrenheit is the default for the time being (e.g. python weather.py c, python weather.py f Manchester, UK).  You can also enter a different location by running python weather.py Denver,Colorado,US, or python weather.py London,UK, or python weather.py Boston,MA,US.
