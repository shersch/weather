Hello!  This is a simple command line tool that tells you weather conditions.  It requires a `.env` file that contains an API key for OpenWeatherMap `APPID="API_KEY"`, and contains your preferred default units (metric, imperial).  `DEF_UNITS="imperial"`.  Once that is in place, you can run the script with no arguments, and it will tell the weather of your geographical location (e.g. `python weather.py`).  Your geographical location is determined based on your public IP address, so it won't work properly if you're on a VPN.  You can pass the arguments `-c` or `-f` to change between metric and imperial (e.g. `python weather.py -c`, `python weather.py -f Manchester,UK`).  You can also enter a different location by running python `weather.py Denver,Colorado,US`, or `python weather.py London,UK`, or `python weather.py Boston,MA,US`.
